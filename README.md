📌 Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression
📍 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations, as high turnover leads to increased recruitment costs, reduced productivity, and loss of experienced talent.
This project uses Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, job role, salary, and work environment factors.
The objective is to help HR departments make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.
🎯 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employee data
Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition
Build and train a Logistic Regression model
Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
Provide insights to reduce employee turnover
🛠 Technologies Used
